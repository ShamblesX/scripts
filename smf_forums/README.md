# SMF Scripts

## export_db.php

In order to use this script, upload it to your webhost, and modify the parameters ```$smf_install``` and ```$output_dir``` to point to the directory on your webhost where SMF is installed, and the directory where you want the files to be created, respectively.

The script will create the directory if it doesn't already exist and put the files in there.

Basic filename sanitation is done, but I didn't need much more so ... use at your own risk ;)
